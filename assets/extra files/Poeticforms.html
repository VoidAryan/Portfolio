                 <h3>Different poetic forms:</h3>
                <br>
                <b>Sonnet:</b>
                <br>

                A sonnet is traditionally a 14-line poem composed in iambic pentameter. This means each line should have ten syllables, following a pattern of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. The most common types of sonnets are the Shakespearean, or English, sonnet and the Petrarchan, or Italian, sonnet. The Shakespearean sonnet consists of three quatrains, each with four lines, followed by a rhymed couplet, making the rhyme scheme ABABCDCDEFEFGG.

               <b> Haiku: </b>
                <br>
                The Haiku is a traditional Japanese form that emphasizes simplicity and depth. It consists of three lines with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5, focusing on nature or fleeting moments. Haikus often include a seasonal reference, capturing a specific moment in time with clarity and brevity. This form challenges poets to distill their thoughts into a compact structure, making it perfect for evoking powerful imagery and emotions in just a few words.

                <br>
                <b>Limerick:</b>
                <br>
                The Limerick is a five-line poem characterized by its playful and humorous tone. With a distinctive rhythm and rhyme scheme of AABBA, limericks are known for their whimsical and often absurd content. The rhythmic quality and structured rhyme scheme make limericks ideal for light-hearted and amusing verses, offering a contrast to more serious poetic forms. Their ability to convey humor and entertainment in a concise format is a key feature of this form.

                <b>Villanelle:</b>
                <br>
                The Villanelle is a 19-line poem that is notable for its repetitive structure and musical quality. It follows a strict rhyme scheme of ABA ABA ABA ABA ABA ABAA, with two refrains that alternate throughout the poem and come together in the final lines. This repetitive pattern creates a hypnotic effect and allows poets to explore obsessive or emotionally intense themes. The villanelle’s musicality and structure make it well-suited for conveying deep emotional resonance or thematic exploration.
